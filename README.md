## Notes

Because I keep forgetting how this project works or looks like. I also hate NextJS.

### Content Management

ContentLayer is apparently exclusive to NextJS.

- Package: `contentlayer` is used to manage content and transform mdx to javascript objects.
- Package: `next-contentlayer` is specifically used for bundling + rendering 'blog stuff' (specifically the mdx content, the frontmatter, no need for this).
- Configurations for collection schemas are stored in `contentlayer.config.ts`.
- `next.config.js` is used attaching the build process of contentlayer to NextJS dev and build.
- All the mdx content is stored in `content/` folder.
