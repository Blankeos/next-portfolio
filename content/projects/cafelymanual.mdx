## My First Markdown Blog with NextJS

In essence, Cafe.ly Manual is just an extension of Cafely, like a "Help" documentation directory. Inside, I talk about how to use Cafely and cover other technical aspects related to the project.

It was my first real attempt at building a blog powered by markdown. Back then, native MDX support in NextJS wasn't readily available, which made the project a fun challenge. It was super cool to build, though! I learned how to use `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` for the first time, and these were quintessential for getting the whole thing to work.

Funnily enough, this manual website wasn't strictly necessary for my teacher's requirements, she only wanted a simple PDF made with PowerPoint or something. Apart from trying to exceed expectations for my grades, I genuinely just wanted to learn. Cafely was literally my first big project after diving into full-stack web development after only two months! I was completely hooked on exploring the possibilities of web development, and building a blog seemed like a fantastic learning experience that I hadn't yet tackled, despite having already built a full-blown application with authentication and a database.
