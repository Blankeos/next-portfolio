### About the Project

**ScolioVis** is a research project I accomplished in college as a senior at West
Visayas State University in 2022-2023. It's definitely one of my proudest works
having been able to demonstrate training a model from scratch to deploying it on
a consumable REST API for inference to creating a web application that actually
makes inference interactive and useful! âœ¨

### Motivation

Initially, I always wanted to try something out with Computer Vision to automate
some sort of manual problem. My groupmate, Glecy, who has scoliosis, mentioned a
manual operation that radiologists do when she sends her spine images for
assessment.

Long story short, the process involves a short few steps. But those steps were
repeatable enough that it actually made sense for us to apply Computer Vision
on it.

So we went ahead and searched up if there were any similar studies. To no surprise,
there was a lot. So yeah, at first we thought we came up with something novel and
untouched here but there was actually a ton of research in this field.

One thing we found though is that there was definitely a lot of room for improvement
in accuracy. Not only that, but since it was mostly just "research" around this
project, there wasn't actually an intuitive interface for radiologists or anyone
to ACTUALLY make the models useful to real users. So we also thought of implementing and deploying
the model on a real, usable web application.

Hope you enjoy this! Thanks!
