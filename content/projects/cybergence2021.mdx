**Cybergence 2021** was CICT's (my college's) yearly acquaintance event, bringing students from different sections and year levels together in mixed teams so we can get to know each other. The CICT Student Council initially shared team distributions via a PDF file. I thought we could do better so I personally took initiative in making a website to make searching for which teams someone can belong to.

I built a landing site using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, incorporating Fuse.js for fast client-side search. I collaborated with other student developers, and we created a user-friendly portal that significantly improved the event experience. The live demo and GitHub repository are available for viewing.

I was a beginner in web dev at the time so I didn't really share it with the student council until I finished it. But after I did, it was super rewarding!
