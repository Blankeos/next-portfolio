Another project I worked on for our acquaintance event in 2023! This was a fun one, mainly because I wanted to give Next.js 13 a shot â€“ it had just come out around that time, and honestly, it wasn't even fully stable yet.

I was also playing around with the idea of a Vercel-like interactive ticket that would appear after logging in. It doesn't really _do_ anything, but I thought it looked pretty cool!
