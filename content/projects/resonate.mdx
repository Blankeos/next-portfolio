### It was a hackathon project

So, I recently participated in WebDevCody's hackathon, powered by the awesome Convex. It was a whirlwind of coding, designing, and a whole lot of learning. The result? Resonate, a fullstack audio social app.

This was my first real tango with Convex, and honestly, I was impressed. Everything is typesafe by default and the migrations are automatic (I literally did not have to think about it). Though, I decided to build the authentication from scratch using session auth, even though Convex usually suggests using a separate service like Clerk. I wanted to get my hands dirty and understand the process inside and out.

The entire project started with a design on Figma. Once I had a vision, I jumped straight into Svelte. And let me tell you, Svelte is a _dream_ to work with. This was one of my first major projects using it, and I was blown away by how easy it was to create UI, build pages, implement animations, and handle the simple logic. Seriously, if you're looking for a fun and efficient framework, give Svelte a try.

### Did I win?

Did I win? Nope. Did I get noticed? Not really, haha. The competition was fierce! Everyone else was building these super complex, realtime games with Convex that were seriously impressive. But that's okay! For me, Resonate was all about the experience.

It was incredibly valuable to build a full-blown application with features like blob storage (Convex provides an S3-like service), authentication, and standard backend APIs. It really solidified my understanding of fullstack development and gave me the confidence to tackle even bigger projects in the future. Even if Resonate didn't win any awards, it definitely won a special place in my coding journey.
