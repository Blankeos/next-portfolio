I figured out a way to make VS Code transparent. For these cases, you may want to use the infamous [APC Customize UI++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drcika.apc-extension).

But because VSCode constantly pushes updates that makes some of these extensions break for a while, I'll just show you my most
reliable way of doing it that usually works for every version (if you have a brain): **monkeypatching**.

## Quick Steps

1. Edit the `main.js` file:

```sh
# (Mac) If you're on regular VSCode.
code /Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/main.js

# (Mac) If you're on VSCode Insiders. (I use this if I have a company GitHub account)
code /Applications/Visual\ Studio\ Code\ -\ Insiders.app/Contents/Resources/app/out/main.js

# (Windows), I actually don't know yet. Feel free to add a comment where `main.js` is.
```

2. Search for `r.getBackgroundColor`. You should see something along the lines of this. There will always be one variable that looks exactly like this. Do your best to find it!

```js
// main.js
l={backgroundColor:r.getBackgroundColor(),...},
```

3. Finally, just add these properties to the `l` object.

```js
// main.js
l = { opacity: 0.95, backgroundColor: r.getBackgroundColor() };
```

4. Make sure to **save without formatting** (use the command palette) so it stays minified, and Cmd + Q to quit VSCode. After reopening, you should see a transparent VSCode.

## Extra Notes

- You might see a popup called 'Your Code installation appears to be corrupt. Please reinstall', you might want to "Don't Show Again" this so it doesn't pop-up again.
- Also, if you want **glassmorphism** or **glassy effect**, you can try by adding these properties to the `l` object. (PS, I have never gotten this to work because VSCode may be blocking this part, but you can try).

  ```js
  // main.js
  l={
    vibrancy:"fullscreen-ui", // MacOS (If not, try 'ultra-dark' this was the old value that Mac used)
    backgroundMaterial: 'acrylic', // Windows 11
    opacity:0.95,
    backgroundColor: r.getBackgroundColor(),
    ...
  }
  ```

- More info on how Electron sets vibrancy/glass/acrylic (the glassy effect) can be found in their official docs:

  - [`win.setBackgroundMaterial` (Windows)](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/browser-window#winsetbackgroundmaterialmaterial-windows)
  - [`win.setVibrancy` (MacOS)](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/browser-window#winsetvibrancytype-macos)

- Try [vscode-vibrancy-continued](https://github.com/illixion/vscode-vibrancy-continued) if you're at a dead-end with glass.
