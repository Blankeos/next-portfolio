Learned something new recently while I was contributing to an open source project called [Vike](https://github.com/vikejs/vike) - a Vite-based metaframework alternative to Next.js, Solid Start, etc.

I'm also writing this post to share what I learned, because there's surprisingly very little info about this.

I essentially made **Nested Layouts** possible in SolidJS.

```sh
# File System setup
pages/
  +Layout.tsx # Root Layout
    dashboard/
      +Page.tsx
      +Layout.tsx # Dashboard Layout
```

```tsx
// What it looks like in the component tree
<RootLayout>
  <DashboardLayout>
    <Page />
  </DashboardLayout>
</RootLayout>
```

The above component tree looks super simple because you're viewing this as a static component tree.
But what if it was a dynamic component tree? How do you even achieve something like this? Imagine, you had:

- An array of components (`FlowComponent[]` - the layouts).
- A child (`JSX.Element` - the page to render).

```tsx
function PageRenderer(props: FlowComponent) {
  const layouts: FlowComponent[] = [RootLayout, DashboardLayout];

  // How would you even wrap `layouts` around children?
  return (
    props.children
  )
```

### In React, it's a bit simpler

As inefficient react is, the plain and simple paradigm of "run everything" works out for this kind of situation.

```tsx
function PageRenderer(props: React.FC<PropsWithChildren>) {
  const [layouts, setLayouts] = useState([RootLayout, DashboardLayout]);

  let page = props.children;
  layouts.forEach((Layout) => {
    page = <Layout>{page}</Layout>; // You just need to keep wrapping page with the Layout.
  });

  return page;
}
```

That's it. And if `layouts` changes. React would be smart enough to re-render the composition properly.

### In SolidJS, it's a bit more complicated.

Turns out this a bit tricky to do in SolidJS because:

- Everything in the function body is only executed once. So the above code would actually only work after the first run. But won't re-evaluate when
  `layouts` change.
- You don't want to re-render EVERY layout everytime `layouts` changes, because Solid has no concept of "keys". We only reconcile.
- You can't do early returns. So doing a recursive approach on the component level is not possible. (But I'll show you a neat trick later)

But if you nail it, SolidJS actually is very efficient ‚ö°Ô∏è.

### So how do we do it?

I came up with two ways to accomplish wrapping components in SolidJS.

#### 1. The functional recursion approach using `createComponent`.

```tsx
function PageRenderer(props: FlowComponent) {
  const [layouts, setLayouts] = createStore<FlowComponent[]>([
    RootLayout,
    DashboardLayout,
  ]);

  function renderLayouts(index: number = 0) {
    let layout = layouts[index];

    if (!layout) return props.children; // Base case. (Terminates here).

    return createComponent(layout, {
      get children(): JSX.Element {
        return renderLayouts(index + 1); // Recursive case.
      },
    });
  }

  return <>{renderLayouts(0)}</>;
}
```

- If you read this code, it obviously doesn't look readable compared to React's lol. üòÖ Get used to it. But it's actually very efficient.
- Thanks to `get children()`, the components only need to render when they need to (i.e. when `layouts` changes)
- `renderLayouts(0)` also only gets called once. Reactivity is handled by the getters.

#### 2. Use `Match` and `Switch` to simulate an early return.

```tsx
// Helper component that handles wrapping using Switch/Match
const WrapWithLayouts = (props: { layouts: FlowComponent[], children: JSX.Element, index: number }) => {
  return (
    <Switch fallback={children}>
      <Match when={props.index < layouts.length}>
        {(() => {
          const CurrentComponent = props.layouts[props.index];
          return (
            <CurrentComponent>
              <WrapWithLayouts layouts={props.layouts} index={props.index + 1}>
                {props.children}
              </WrapWithLayouts>
            </CurrentComponent>
          );
        })()}
      </Match>
    </Switch>
  );
};

function PageRenderer() {
  const [layouts, setLayouts] = createStore<FlowComponent[]>([
    RootLayout,
    DashboardLayout,
  ]);

  return <WrapWithLayouts layouts={layouts} index=0>I am page</WrapWithLayouts>
}
```

- This one is a lot more complicated but it kind of demonstrates how you can actually kind of do "early returns" in SolidJS.
- Using `Switch` and `Match` you can essentially "early return" with the fallback.
