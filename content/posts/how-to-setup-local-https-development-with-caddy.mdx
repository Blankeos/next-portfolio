Here's a quick guide on how to setup local HTTPS development with Caddy.

### üìù What is Caddy?

[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) is a web server that's designed to be fast, secure, easy to use, and to automate a lot of the things you'd normally have to do manually. But it's more notorious as a reverse proxy.

And take my word for it, it's way easier to setup than NGINX (albeit negligibly slower), and it's way faster than Apache.

### Why you might want to use Caddy in local development

It's the perfect tool for local development with HTTPS. It's easy to setup, so you won't need to dockerize anything. Here are also a few reasons why you might want to use Caddy in local development:

- **You're making a geo-based web-app**. The **Geolocation API** is only available over HTTPs
- **Have an HTTPS frontend that needs to query an HTTPS backend.** Can only query HTTPs backends when on an HTTPS frontend.
- **You want your HTTPs to be accessible in LAN.** Since you need test your site on a mobile phone.

### Steps

1. **Install Caddy**

Homebrew is the easiest for me. There are [other ways](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install) too!

```sh
$ brew install --cask caddy
```

2. **Create a Caddyfile.**

Assuming your localhost frontend and backend are running on `localhost:3000` and `localhost:4001` respectively, here's what your Caddyfile should look like:

```sh
# Get the ip using `ipconfig getifaddr en0` on Mac.

# Backend
:4000 {
	reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:4001
	tls internal
}

# Frontend
{env.MY_IP} {
	reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000
	tls internal
}
```

Let's break this down:

- `:4000` is the port that you can access your backend on after reverse proxying.
- `reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:4001` is the backend that you're proxying to.
- `tls internal` tells Caddy to use an internal self-signed **certificate** and **key**. Because we're using a local IPv4 address, Caddy actually doesn't see it as a domain, so it won't create a secure certificate for it.
- `{env.MY_IP}` is the syntax that Caddy uses to access environment variables. In this case, it's accessing the `MY_IP` environment variable that we'll set later.

3. **Run the Server**

When running, we just need to set `MY_IP` with the IPv4 address of our local machine. I'm on a Mac, so I'll use this `ipconfig getifaddr en0` command to get the IPv4 address of my local machine.

```sh
$ MY_IP=$(ipconfig getifaddr en0) caddy run --config Caddyfile
```

And... That's it! ü•≥ You should be able to access your backend and frontend of HTTPs now.

4. **Optional: You can also make this easier by adding a script to your `package.json` file.**

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "MY_IP=$(ipconfig getifaddr en0) caddy run --config Caddyfile",
  },
}
```
