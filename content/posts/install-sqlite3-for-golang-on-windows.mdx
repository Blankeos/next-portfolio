This is a short guide on how you can make sqlite3 work for Golang on Windows.
If you've ever ran sqlite3 for Golang on Windows, you may have noticed that it
needs some environment variable working:

```properties
CGO_ENABLED=1
```

Usually this isn't enough though, that's because you need the gcc binary to run
sqlite3 on Windows. Follow the instructions below.

### 1. Install MSYS2

Go to the [MSYS2 website](https://www.msys2.org/) and follow the installation
instructions. Note that MSYS2 requires 64 bit Windows 8.1 or newer.

Once you're go to the [ðŸªŸ Start] and search: "MSYS2 UCRT64", this opens the
UCRT64 environment of MSYS2, basically a shell. Note that MSYS2 has different
environments and this is basically the default that it's running on.

After that, install the MinGW-w64-toolchain by running this command:

```sh
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain
```

Accept the default number of packages in the toolchain group by pressing Enter.

Enter Y when prompted whether to proceed with the installation.

Add the path to your MinGW-w64 bin folder to the Windows PATH environment variable by using the following steps:

In the Windows search bar, type Settings to open your Windows Settings.
Search for Edit environment variables for your account.
In your User variables, select the Path variable and then select Edit.
Select New and add the MinGW-w64 destination folder you recorded during the installation process to the list. If you used the default settings above, then this will be the path: C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin.
Select OK to save the updated PATH. You will need to reopen any console windows for the new PATH location to be available.

Check the installation

```
gcc --verison
```
